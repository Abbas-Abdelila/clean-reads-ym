## What is noun phrase?

**Noun phrase** — a group of words with at least two different **names** or **nouns**(“*isim”*) one being the main character and the other(s) complementing it. 

## Why do they exist?

Let us see why they are important with an example.

<aside>
📝 Let us just try translating “Car door”  to Turkish.
”Car” → “Araba”
”Door” → “Kapı”

So let us just combine the two.
 “Araba + kapı” → “Araba kapı” 

So we’re good to go! We are done!
🔴 I have bad news for you **NO WE ARE NOT!** 🔴

Unlike English, in Turkish you have to show there exists a relationship between the word “Car” and “door” explicitly. 
If you don’t link the two words with some **connector,** this connector is **suffix** in Turkish, it become meaningless.

📌 **What if I don’t use connectors?**
It is a good question. Well Saying “*Araba kapı*” and not “*Araba kapısı*” is just like saying 
“Car [long pause] door” no connection can be drawn between the two words.    

The whole point is learning how to use this **connectors** and that’s what we are going to do in this article.
