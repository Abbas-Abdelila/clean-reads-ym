System programming is the use of system tools during program development to save time and effort, access core functions of the operating system, promote standards, and facilitate program management. This text explores the concepts of system programming and lower-level data types with the goal of advancing the programming skill of the reader.

Windows is designed to be easy to use for the typical user, but this comes at the cost of limited information on the system's inner workings and lack of modularity. In contrast, Unix and Linux are open source, modular, and highly configurable, making them attractive for students studying system operation.

### The Three Tools

1. Shell
2. Text-editor
3. Debugger

Q. Why should we run a program in a terminal if we can just click on the icon?

Suppose one desired to start the word processor with some of those options changed? A shell provides for this through command line arguments. A command line argument is anything typed at the shell prompt after the name of the program to execute. It provides information about how the user wishes

The `alias` command in Unix is used to create a new name or command that can be used to represent a longer command or set of commands. This can be used to simplify complex commands, to make them easier to remember or type, or to reduce the amount of typing when running the same command multiple times. The `alias` command is often used in combination with other commands, such as `grep` or `sed`, to create a shorter and more readable command.

### The *alias* command

What does alias do in unix and show me its use case and why to use it?

In Unix-like operating systems, an alias is a way to create a new name for a command or set of commands. Aliases can be used to simplify complex commands, shorten long commands, or make frequently used commands easier to remember.

For example, you can create an alias for a long and complex command as follows:

```bash
alias ls='ls --color=auto'
```

Now, whenever you type "ls" in the terminal, it will run the **`ls --color=auto`** command. This can be useful for simplifying a command that you use frequently.

Another use case is creating a short alias for a long command. For example, you can create an alias as follows:

```bash
alias ll='ls -l'
```

Now, whenever you type "ll" in the terminal, it will run the **`ls -l`** command. This can be useful for making a frequently used command easier to remember and quicker to type.

It's important to note that aliases are specific to the current shell session, meaning that if you log out or open a new terminal window, the aliases will not be available. To make the aliases permanent, you'll need to add them to your shell's startup file, such as **`.bashrc`** or **`.bash_profile`**.

> **Common shell internal commands.**

alias â†’ Create an alias
cd â†’ Change directory
pwd â†’ Print current working directory
set â†’ Give a shell variable a value
which â†’ Identify full path of program

**Common System Program commands**

grep â†’Search files for specific text
ls â†’ List files and their attributes
man â†’ Display manual (help) for command/program
more â†’ Display a text file using pausable scrolling
time â†’ Measure the running time of a program
sort â†’ Sort lines in a text fil

> When compiling to debug we need to flag -g, this makes the compiler not optimized for running fast as a result the size is larger than the one just compiled with gcc filename.c
> 

### gcc filename.c  vs gcc -g filename.c

```bash
root@DESKTOP-86SENMJ:~/Abbas/sys_prog examples# gcc sum.c
root@DESKTOP-86SENMJ:~/Abbas/sys_prog examples# ls -l a.out
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 15952 Feb  9 07:12 a.out
root@DESKTOP-86SENMJ:~/Abbas/sys_prog examples# gcc -g sum.c
root@DESKTOP-86SENMJ:~/Abbas/sys_prog examples# ls -l a.out
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 17216 Feb  9 07:12 a.out
```

### GCC compilation and use of GNU debugger

1. Setup for execution. `-g` initializes the symbol table for debugging,
`-o` allow to rename a.out compiled file to custom name.

```bash
root@DESKTOP-86SENMJ:~/Abbas/sys_prog examples# gcc -g -o sum sum.c
root@DESKTOP-86SENMJ:~/Abbas/sys_prog examples# ./sum
Sum = 29
```

2.  To start the debugger for the code.

```bash
root@DESKTOP-86SENMJ:~/Abbas/sys_prog examples# gdb sum
